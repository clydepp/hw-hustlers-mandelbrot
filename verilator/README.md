# Verilator

Simulate your designs with verilator. 

Follow the instructions to setup verilator in WSL from [IAC](https://github.com/EIE2-IAC-Labs/Lab0-devtools).

To run the simulation, run the `doit.sh` script. Make sure to be in its directory. <br>

> If it says that you don't have permissions
> - run the command: <br>
> `chmod +x doit.sh` 

Then open GTKWave and open the appropriate .vcd file to view your waveforms. 

**TODO:** 
<ol> 
<li> fix the testbench, giving wrong waveform </li>
<li> wrap the vcd, converting into an image </li>
